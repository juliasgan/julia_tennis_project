# julia_tennis_project
End of year project that keeps score of tennis matches
#Things that I need to do/experiement wit/basic ideas: 

#USE ClASSES, METHODS, and OBJECTS
#-start by making a few classes 
#-one class will represent a whole team (program an entire class structure representing the team) 
#-each team should have an array of classes or two classes (singles and doubles) 
#-(use polymorphism?: make an abstract tennis player class and then subclasses for singles and doubles)representing the players and then each player should have an array of classes representing their scores.
#-(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1031273/what-is-polymorphism-what-is-it-for-and-how-is-it-used)
#-In my class structure, I should probably have a method called "match" or something like that where if I did team1.match(team2) it would make team1 play against team 2
#-the code for the match method would call another method (maybe play) which is called on players within the teams, making players within the teams play each other.
#-use a play method (where two players play each other) either have a random result, or have the user input the result (for example by just using the input function in python).
#-set up the structure of a team first so I can make teams with specific statistics/properties.Each team should have a score, number of matches played, a name, names of players, etc.
